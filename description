The task for this project is to build a classification model capable of identifying the speaker of each recording in the evaluation set.
Please note that the recordings for the evaluation set have been extracted from different chapters/books
than those in the development set. As such, overfitting will be particularly penalized in this context (a
model that learns to identify the “book” rather than the speaker will have troubles generalizing to neverbefore-seen recordings).
